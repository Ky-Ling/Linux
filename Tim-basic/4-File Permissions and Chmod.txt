1: ls -l
    display our files in this long View:
    
    Each column:
    1: file permissions or the file mode. The first character stands for what type of file it is: "d" --> directory, 
        "-" --> regular file. The last 9 characters represent the permissions for this file and for specific users(read these 
        three by three). "rwx" --> read, write and execute. And these three sets of characters stand for "permission for user",
        "permission for group" and "permission for all users".
    2: number of files that contains within this file or within this directory
    3: first root: the user who owns this file or created this file 
    4: second root: the group that this file belongs to, same as user name
    5: size of this file or this directory
    6: crated date and time
    7: file name or directory name


2: chmod 
    --> Change the permissions of these files or directories. "chmod" --> change mode 
    
    chmod [who] [+, -, =] [permission(s)] filename
    chmod -R [who] [+, -, =] [permission(s)] directory name  --> "R" --> recursive
    
    who --> u(user), g(group), o(other), a(all)


    Example:
    (1): chmod a+w abc.txt
        --> Change the permission of this file so that all users can write to this file 
        ls -l --> go to Check(all users and groups can have this permission now)

    (2): chmod u+x abc.txt
        --> Only allow the user can execute this file
    
    (3): chmod -R a+w a
        --> Add a write ability for all users in the a directory

3: (1): chmod -R a-w a 
    Remove permission
   
   (2): chmod -R a=w a
    Set permission
   
   (3): chmod a=wr abcd.txt

    
4: What happens when we do not specific a user?
    (1): chmod +x abcd.txt 
        Add this permission for all the users
    
    (2): chmod -x abcd.txt 
        Remove this permission for all the users

5: How to set multiple permissions at the same time?
    chmod g+w, o-r, a+x abcd.txt
