1: Creating a shell script
    (1): nano test.sh
    (2): #!/bin/bash
        --> Add a shebang: #!"name of the shell"
    (3): # this is a comment
        --> Write a comment
    (4): echo "Hello World"
         echo "Hi"

         --> After these two command, Exit
    (5): ./test.sh
        --> Executing shell script, but we may do not have permission, so we have to add permission to execute this file
    (6): chmod +x test.sh
    (7): ./test.sh
        --> Now we get the result
    (8): nano test.sh
    (9): print() {
            echo "This is a function"
         }

         print
         print

        --> Implement function (When we call this print function, we do not need to add "()"


(10): Passing parameters to function:

print() {
    echo "This is a function $1 $3"
} 

print "Hello"
print this is good



(11): 
x=3
echo $x

--> Make a variables (do not have space between variable name and "=")


(12): 

exit 0

--> Exit command, add this lind in the end (exit 0 --> success, exit 1 --> fail)


(13): 
control() {
    if [[ $1 = "Tim" ]]; then 
        echo "Hello Tim"
    elif [[ $2 = "David" ]]; then
        read -p "Name: " text
        echo "text"
    else 
        echo "Tim is not here"
    fi
}

control "Tim"
control "Brian"
control "Brian" "David"
