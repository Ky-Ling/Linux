1: (1): grep pattern filename
    (2): grep A file.txt
        --> Find the pattern A in this file.txt, and will print out the line of in which these matches occur

2: Regular expression
    (1): grep "A." file.txt
        --> It will match any character or symbol with this period
    (2): grep "A.A" file.txt
    (3): grep "[A, B] .A" file.txt
        [x, y] match either x or y 
        --> Look for anything that starts with A or B, then has any symbol, then ends with A

    (4): grep "A.B\|B.A" file.txt
        --> "\|" search for one pattern or another

    (5): grep AB$ file.txt
        --> $ matches end of the line
    (6): grep ^AB file.txt
        --> ^ matches start of the line

3: grep options
    (1): grep -n ABD file.txt 
        --> Get the number of lines
    (2): grep -o AB file.txt
        --> Only show this pattern with ignoring other letters

    (3): grep -c 4 A.A file.txt
         --> Show us lines after the matched pattern. "-c k": show k lines surrounding all matches


4: Filtering outputs with grep
    (1): ls | grep AB
        --> ls | grep "pattern"

    (2): cat file.txt | grep AB


5: Grepping directories:


    (1): grep -r hello root
        --> -r recursively searches in the directory. It will show us all of the "hello" in any of the file that are inside of 
            this root directory
