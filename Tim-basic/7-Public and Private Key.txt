Public/Private Key Authentication(RSA) & FTP

1: RSA KEY PAIRS:
    - Public Key: is stored on the server 
    - Private Key: is stored on local machine

2: After installing the application
    (1): Change to number of the generated key to 4096 and make sure RSA is selected
    (2): After clicking "Generate" --> Fill in the passphrase
    (3): "Save Public key" and "Save private key" --> txt and ppk extension

3: Go to Putty
    (1): Load the setting file we just saved
    (2): Connection -> SSH -> Auth -> Select the private key file 
    (3): Session -> Save the file folder
    (4): "Open" and sign in root user

4: Add Public key into this machine
    (1): cd .ssh
        --> If we do not have a ssh folder, we have to create a new folder
    (2): mkdir .ssh
    (3): cd .shh
    (4): touch authorized_keys
    (5): cd ..
    
    (6): chmod a+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx ./ssh
    (7): cd .ssh
    (8): chmod a+rwx,u-x,g-rwx,o-rwx authorized_keys
        --> Add permission for this folder and this file 

    (9): nano authorized_keys
        --> Add public key into this file
        --> Copy the content of the public key file paste into this file 
        --> Before the file line of code --> we type: ssh-rsa 
        --> And all the keys have to be on one line
        --> CTRL + S and CTRL + X
    (10): logout or exit

    (11): go to Putty and load the file folder and open it.
    (12): Then it automatically authenticate me.

5: FTP access
    (1): Download FileZilla
    (2): Open it (port: 22) --> QuickConnect
    (3): Edit -> settings -> SFTP -> Add key file (private key) -> OK
    (4): We clear the password for the root user. Now we can connect to the server and fill in to passphrase 
    (5): And now we are signing into the server
